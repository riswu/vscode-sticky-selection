| ctrl+alt+left  | Execute `cursorWordPartLeftSelect` when in sticky-selection-mode (macOS)             |

If you are an Emacs user, you can enable the mode for `ctrl+v` and `alt+v` by editing `keybindings.json` as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "ctrl+v",
    "command": "cursorPageDown",
    "when": "textInputFocus"
  },
  {
    "key": "alt+v",
    "command": "cursorPageUp",
    "when": "textInputFocus"
  },
  {
    "key": "ctrl+v",
    "command": "cursorPageDownSelect",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && inStickySelectionMode"
  },
  {
    "key": "alt+v",
    "command": "cursorPageUpSelect",
    "when": "editorTextFocus && inStickySelectionMode"
  }
]
```

In such manners, you can support other move commands including those of third parties.

By default, sticky-selection-mode continues even if you execute commands such as cut and paste. You can exit the mode after execution by taking these commands as arguments to `sticky-selection.exitStickySelectionMode` as follows:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "cmd+x",
    "command": "sticky-selection.exitStickySelectionMode",
    "args": {
      "command": "editor.action.clipboardCutAction",
      "interval": 100
    },
    "when": "editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly && inStickySelectionMode"
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+c",
    "command": "sticky-selection.exitStickySelectionMode",
    "args": {
      "command": "editor.action.clipboardCopyAction",
      "interval": 100
    },
    "when": "editorTextFocus && inStickySelectionMode"
  },
  {
    "key": "cmd+v",
    "command": "sticky-selection.exitStickySelectionMode",
    "args": {
      "command": "editor.action.clipboardPasteAction",
      "interval": 100
    },
    "when": "editorTextFocus && !editorReadonly && inStickySelectionMode"
  }
]
```

In such manners, you can support other commands such as `backspace` and `delete`.
